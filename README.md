# My Coding Samples
It is a repo including examples of my coding samples. All of them I wrote during my undergraduate studies at New Economic School.

1. ```yolo``` is a deep learning example (Pytorch, Pytorch Lighting, numpy).
2. ```business_analytics``` is a sample homework I did for the business analytics course (cvxpy, scipy).
3. ```math_fin``` is a sample homework I did for Mathematical Finance course, which includes many numercial examples and simulations (numpy, matplotlib, numba).

Another examples of my code are

- [Conjoint Repo](https://github.com/krsafonov/conjoint) is an application developed in R which consists of 2 parts: the optimal conjoint design and an application for online surveys (R packages: shiny, idefix).
- [Telegram Bot](https://github.com/krsafonov/blade_runner_bot) is a final project developed in Python using asyncio. It is a text quest game.
